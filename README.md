# JavaScript React Native - Contact Book

Simple contacts-app made with React-Native as a one day mob-programming project during a React-Native lecture week. 
Uses a authentication service and database from Firebase to make the contacts cloud-based instead of local.
Contains basic unit and component testing with react-native-tesing library and Jest.

UI more or less done, needs some more functionality before being completed.

2022-10-06 update

Continued on from the bones of mob-week and refactored the code to be more modular and added mail, sms and calling functionality as well as some UI and other minor tweeks.
